<h2><b>Problem:</b></h2>
<br>
In today's world, a lot of people seem to ignore mental illness. This is reflected in the sharp incline in suicide rates every year, particularly in India. 
<br>
<h2><b>Solution:</b></h2>
<br>
I have created an anti-depression/suicide helpline for those in need. It takes a lot of courage to reach out for help. I want to make sure that they recieve a good response which helps them to recover and understand that they are not alone.
I have first given a national hotline number at the very top of the page. If somebody is vulnerable, they look out for numbers the very first thing. Then i have given a navbar. The 'call us' option gives the specific helplines for women, seniors, children and men in case they are facing any kind of assault or any such thing. The 'donate' option is necessary because for any organisation to function smoothly, they require funds. This will be used if the victims are in dire need of financial help. The 'get involved' option helps one to participate in helping others. I thought of creating a form to join our team but didn't hace time lol. The 'feedback' option is to ensure that a person is fully satisfied with our service. If not, a mail id is provided to hear their inconveniences. I have given hyperlinks in the end to the instagram and facebook pages(of course they are random pages, but serve the same purpose).
